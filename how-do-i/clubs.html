      <p><b>How to Join a Club:</b><br>
        First you'll want to browse what clubs are currently available for you

      </p>
      <p><b>Ordered by: </b>Allows you to sort the clubs alphabetically by: <b>Club 
        Name</b> or <b>Keyword</b> (as listed by the club leader); and numerically 
        by <b>Club Creation Date</b> and <b>Number</b> of Members. Choose one 
        and then click the <b>Apply</b> button.<br>
        <b>Club Name:</b> You can type in the full club name or just the first 
        few letters and then click the <b>Apply</b> button. <br>
        Checking the <b>My Clubs</b> box will apply these filters to show only 
        the clubs that you have joined. </p>

      <p>You can browse by one or two keywords from the predefined list on the 
        pull down menus plus you can type in a keyword that is not on the predefined 
        list. If you decide to search using two or more keywords then all the 
        keywords you define will be used to filter through the clubs. Hit the 
        <b>Apply</b> button.<br>
      </p>
      <p>If the search engine doesn't find all your keywords listed for any one 
        club then your search has failed and you should try again. </p>

        in 3D mode you'll be transported to a 3D clubhouse. </p>
      <p align="left">You can find out more about the Club via the buttons you'll 
        find below the Cybertown Control Panel on the right. If you decide later

      <b>How to Visit a Club:</b><br>
      You can visit any club that you are a member of. If you're like many people, 
      you've probably joined a club or two (or 3 or 4 or 5) and have forgotten 
      their names already. Don't worry...Cybertown will help you keep track of 
      the clubs you have joined and you can generate that list at anytime. You can also visit a Club that you are not a member of just by clicking on the Info link in the Club Directory.
      <ul>
        <li>At <b>Ordered by:</b> choose <b>Club Name</b> from the pull down menu 
        </li>
        <li>Check the <b>My Clubs</b> box </li>
        <li>Hit the <b>Apply</b> button </li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left">This will generate a list with all the clubs you are a member 
        of including any clubs you have created. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Click the name of the club you want to visit and you'll jump to the 
          Club's 2D chat page.</li>
        <li>To enter the 3D clubhouse click the 3D world button. <img src="club_images/b3dchat.gif" width="44" height="31" align="absmiddle" alt="3D World button"></li>
      </ul>
      <p>To keep up with any club events, remember to check their <b>Inbox</b>, 
        <b>Messages</b> and <b>Calendar</b> when you're in the clubhouse.<br>
