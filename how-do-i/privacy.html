      <p>www.cybertown.com provides interactive environments on the Internet to 
        enable members to express themselves and share their ideas and interests 
        by creating and participating in discussion-based virtual communities. 
      </p>
      <p>www.cybertown.com has been fortunate to attract major advertisers and 
        sponsors who are primarily responsible for allowing us to provide all 
        of the services and features we offer and will offer in the future. We 
        understand, and our sponsors understand, that our success and their success 
        are dependent on the goodwill and loyalty of our members and visitors. 
      </p>
      <p>Cybertown, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate 
        our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information 
        gathering and dissemination practices for this website: www.cybertown.com.</p>
      <p><p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, 
and to administer our Web site.  Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information.
      <p>Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to make 
        sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. We use cookies to deliver content 
        specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have 
        to reenter it each time you visit our site unless the browser you are 
        using has been closed. 
      <p>Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information 
        (like a name and e-mail address), unique identifiers (like a nickname), 
        and demographic information (like a zip code, age, or income level). In 
        the future we may use customer contact information from the registration 
        form to send the user promotional material from some of our partners. 
        The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor 
        when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the 
        choice/opt-out section below. Unique identifiers (such as a nickname) 
        are collected to verify the user's identity and for use as account identification 
        in our record system. Demographic and profile data is also collected at 
        our site. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, 
        showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying 
        the content according to their preferences. This information is shared 
        with advertisers on an aggregate basis. 
      <p>This site contains links to other sites.  <b>www.cybertown.com</b> is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
      <p>
      <p>We use the aggregate data we collect to perform statistical analyses 
        of the collective characteristics and behavior of our members and visitors, 
        to measure user demographics and interests regarding specific areas of 
        the www.cybertown.com domain and to analyze how and where to invest our 
        resources. We also use the aggregate data collected to inform our sponsors 
        as to numbers of people who have seen and "clicked" on their advertisement. 
        We will also disclose to those third-party sponsors the overall demographics 
        available regarding who saw and "clicked" on their advertisement. No personally 
        identifiable information will be disclosed to these advertisers as part 
        of this process; only information in an aggregate form. Without the data 
        collected, we would not know what the most popular regions of www.cybertown.com 
        are, we would not be able to provide an effective forum for our sponsors 
        to advertise in, nor would we be able to measure which promotions work. 
      <p>
      <p>In the near future this site will use an order form for customers to 
        request information, products, and services. We will collect visitor's 
        contact information, unique identifiers, and financial information (like 
        account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form 
        will be used to send orders and promotional material from some of our 
        partners to our customers. The customer's contact information is also 
        used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out 
        of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial 
        information that is collected will be used to bill the user for products 
        and services. Unique identifiers (such as a nickname) are collected from 
        Web site visitors to verify the user's identity and for use as account 
        numbers in our record system. 
      <p>Our online surveys ask visitors for unique identifiers (like their nickname). 
        Unique identifiers are collected from Web site visitors to verify the 
        user's identity and for use as account numbers in our record system. 
      <p>We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for unique identifiers. 
        Unique identifiers are collected from Web site visitors to verify the 
        user's identity and for use as account numbers in our record system.
