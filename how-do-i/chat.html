      <p><b><a name="overview"></a>Overview:<br>
        </b> If you are a member of Cybertown you can access 2D and 3D chat and 
        message boards and have a virtual blast buying or trading objects and 
        interacting with other people and avatars. You can also invite your friends 
        to your very own 3D home to hang out or party. Not a member? <a href="http://www.cybertown.com/cgi-bin/cybertown/register?backurl=/index.html">Immigrate 
        now</a>! It's free and you're missing the party so hurry-up.</p>
      <hr size="1">
      You can choose to start your chat in 2D or 3D mode by selecting a <b>Chat 
      default</b> on your Personal Info page.<br>
      <br>
      <b><a name="2D"></a>2D Chat:</b><br>
      2D chat is really good if you just want to talk to someone quickly and then 
      get out of town. It is also the way to go when you are using someone else's 
      computer and they don't have the blaxxun Contact software or it wouldn't 
      be right for you to install it there. 
      <p><img src="3d_images/chat2d.gif" width="222" height="168" align="left" vspace="1" hspace="10"> 
        To start chatting when you are in the 2D mode just click in the text box 
        below the chat window and start typing what you want to say. Hit the <b>Enter</b> 
        or <b>Return</b> key on your keyboard or click the <b>Send</b> button. To see the various chat options (colored text, font size, using images) you can type /options in the chat window or go <A HREF="http://www.cybertown.com/java/contact/chatimg/options.html">here</A>.  If you click on a person's name you can whisper to him, invite him to private chat or ignore him.
        Now you're talking! <br>

      <p><b><a name="3D"></a>Requirements for 3D Chat: <br>
        </b>If you are a member of Cybertown you can join in the chat. Not a member 
        yet? What are you waiting for - <a href="http://www.cybertown.com/cgi-bin/cybertown/register?backurl=/index.html">Immigrate 
        now</a>! </p>
      <p>To access 3D chat and enter the 3D worlds in Cybertown you need to download 
        the free plug-in called blaxxun Contact from the blaxxun website. If you 
        haven't done that already then please read <a href="into3d.html">Get Into 
        3D</a> for more information.</p>
      <p> <b>Jump into 3D Chat:<br>
        </b>Okay, just for the record...3D chat is waaaaayyyyy cooler then 2D 
        chat. Once you have the plug-in installed, enter Cybertown and look to 
        the right to find and click the <img src="3d_images/b3dchat.gif" width="44" height="31" align="absmiddle"> 
        button. You will enter the 3D City Plaza. </p>
      <p><img src="3d_images/chat3d.gif" width="299" height="163" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5"><br>
        You get a lot more information on the chatters when you are in 3D. <br clear="all"></p>        
        
If you click on the envelope (see image above) you can send live gestures. The arrows next to this enable you to adjust your font size and the folder opens up many other options such as font, body language, undocking the chat window (to make it bigger, for instance) and  scroll-locking.


<BR><BR>
      <p>If your native language is not English, you can change the labels and 
        standard information in the software to display in an alternate language. 
        <br>
        <img src="3d_images/opt.gif" width="291" height="182" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5"><br>
        Find the <b>Options</b> tab to the right of the chat window and choose 
        <b>Language</b>. You'll get a pop up window from which you can choose 
        English, French, German or Spanish. The other tabs enable you to see who is in the room you're in, which other places are open, which objects are available to buy, what's in your backpack, the chat logs and a number of other options - including changing your avatar (see Get into 3D at the How Do I?" page). If you click on a person's name you can whisper to him, invite him to private chat or ignore him.

        <p><b><a name="voice"></a>Voice Chat:</b><br>
          The preliminary requirement for this software is that you have a sound 
          card in your computer and some kind of speakers. Oh yeah...it only works 
          when you're surfing Cybertown in 3D.</p>
        <p>This is the way to get the Voice Chat software when you are new to 
          Cybertown. </p>
        <p>1. Download the most recent version of the blaxxun Contact software 
          <br>
          2. Sometime during this process you will be asked if you want the additional 
          download of the text to voice software. Say yes. </p>
        <p>So I guess now you want to change the sound of your voice? Read on...</p>
        <p><b>Getting only the Voice Software and how to change your voice:<br>
          </b><br>
          <img src="3d_images/voice.gif" width="321" height="181" align="right">Go 
          to <b>Options</b> and choose <b>Voice</b>, <font color="#00ff00">if 
          you don't already have the Voice software you will be asked if you want 
          it. </font></p>
        <p>After choosing Voice you will get a popup window that will allow you 
          to choose the kind of voice you want to use. You can change your voice 
          at any time.</p>
        <p>Happy Chatting!</p>
