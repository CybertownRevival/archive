Deputies, you've rescued me! <BR><BR>

<P>

But Thermidor has escaped with the Virtuator.<BR>  

You must track him down before he's able to leave
Cybertown for good.  I heard him communicating with Vivoworld.  He said that
he was heading for the outskirts of town and planned to hijack a raft back
to the Halls of Virt and make it through the Tunnel of Gol before the
Earthnet shuts down for good.  Deputies, you must find that raft before he
steals out of Cybertown.  

</P>
<P>
The future of Cybertown depends on you.  Get
Thermidor and that Virtuator!

</P>
