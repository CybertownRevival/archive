<p> Every member of The Mothership Colony has a unique email address. So
  you need your own email address to immigrate.<br>
  If the system tells you that your email is already taken, you or somebody else
  tried to immigrate using that email address. </p>
<p> If you tried it, please <a href="mailto:help@colonycity.com">inform</a> us,
  we will send you the nickname you used before.<br>
  If somebody else tried it, you should try to find out who has used your email
  address and contact him/her. </p>
<p>Could it be possible that you tried to immigrate before but did not finish
  the immigration? If that happened and you are now trying to immigrate with another
  nickname you won't be able to use that email again. Please <a href="mailto:help@colonycity.com">inform</a>
  us so we can check that. </p>
<BR><hr>
<!--###################################--> <a name="nicknametaken"></a> <!--###################################-->
<FONT>My nickname is already taken.</FONT>
<p> Every member in The Mothership Colony has a <b>unique nickname</b>. <br>
  If the system tells you that your nickname is already taken, you or somebody
  else has immigrated before using this nickname. </p>
<p> If you immigrated using that nickname, please login as a member with
  that nickname and your unique password. If you have forgotten the password,
  click "Member" on the welcome page and use the feature "Send Password" to get
  it sent to your email address. If you still have problems, please <a href="mailto:help@colonycity.com">inform</a>
  us and we will send you the password you used before (but only if your email
  address corresponds to the nickname!). If somebody else uses this nickname,
  you have to use another one. Try some numbers or additional characters to get
  your unique nickname. <br>
  Good luck :-) </p>

<!--###################################--> <a name="nicknameforgotten"></a> <!--###################################-->
<FONT>I have forgotten my nickname.</FONT>
<p> If you have forgotten your nickname, please <a href="mailto:help@colonycity.com">send</a>
  us your email address used during immigration. We will send you the corresponding
  nickname. </p>
<BR><hr>
<!--###################################--> <a name="passwordforgotten"></a> <!--###################################-->
<FONT>I have forgotten my password.</FONT>
<p> If you have forgotten your password, please click "Member" on the welcome
  page and use the "Send Password" feature there.<br>
  You <b>must</b> know your nickname - the password is then sent to your email
  address used during immigration. </p>
<BR><hr>
<!--###################################--> <a name="noimmcode"></a> <!--###################################-->
<FONT>I did not receive my immigration code.</FONT>
<p> That should not happen usually - what can you do?
<P>Check your email software - is it working correctly?
  Check if your email address is the same you used/inserted during immigration.<br>
    For this please click "Member" on the welcome page - you will enter the Activation
    page and there you find your email address.
  Check your emails - maybe you got the email since the last time you checked
    your inbox.
  What kind of email software do you use? Please <a href="mailto:help@colonycity.com">send</a>
    us detailed information which could help us solve the problem.</P>
<BR><hr>
<!--###################################--> <a name="changenickname"></a> <!--###################################-->
<FONT>I would like to change my nickname.</FONT>
<p> Your nickname is your identity - as your real name is your identity in real
  life. So it's not possible to change your nickname in The Mothership Colony.
</P>
<BR><hr>
<!--###################################--> <a name="changeemail"></a> <!--###################################-->
<FONT>I would like to change my email.</FONT>
<P> If you would like to change your email, enter The Motherhip Colony and click
  the &quot;My Info&quot; button on the control panel. Next click the &quot;Personal
  Info&quot; link and you will find the location where you can change your email.
</P>
<BR><hr>
<!--###################################--> <a name="nologin"></a> <!--###################################-->
<FONT>I cannot login into The Mothership Colony.</FONT>
<p> That should usually not happen, but if it does - what can you do?
Check your nickname and password (case-sensitive!) - are they typed correctly?
  The Mothership Colony requires browser "<A HREF="#cookies">cookies</A>" for the login - are they
    activated in your browser?
 Did you activate Javascript and Java in your browser?
  If you still have problems, please <a href="mailto:help@colonycity.com">send</a>
    us detailed information which could help us to find the problem.</P>
