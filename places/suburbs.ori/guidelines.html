<h2 align=center>GUIDELINES FOR 3D WORLDS IN COLONY CITY</h2>

<p>
Worlds for Colony City are created using VRML as a programming language. 
Worlds should be created using the latest version of VRML called VRML 2.0.
</p>
<p>
Many <a href="tools.html">Tools/Programs</a> exist to create these worlds.
</p>

<p>
The basic guidelines are:
<ul>
<li>The file size of the world should be under 150K including textures. Your 
world should be compressed (gzipped) to make the file size smaller.
<li>The content of the worlds should adhere to the City Constitution and rules 
(such as no pornographic images, etc...).
<li>There is a World Builders Guild existing in Colony City headed by the
<a href="mailto:architect@colonycity.com">City Architect</a>.
If you need advice or help, contact them.
</ul>
</p>
