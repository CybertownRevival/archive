<h2>
Rules for Creating Objects for Cybertown</h2></center>

<center><font size=+1>Here are a few rules for creating Objects to be sold
in the Mall at Cybertown. In designing Cybertown, great efforts are made
to create VR which runs well on a wide range of computers, even older systems.
These rules are created to promote good VRML building habits, which if
followed, will result in objects that perform well for everyone in Cybertown.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Objects are reviewed by experienced VRML authors before
they are approved for Cybertown. The following rules are the criteria on
which approval or rejection will be based.</font></center>

<p><b><i><font size=+2>Nodes not to include in Objects</font></i></b>
<p>
<hr ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="50%">
<p>The following nodes should not be included in the VRML code you upload
to the Mall. Any Objects containing the following nodes, will be refused.
Of course if you remove the offending nodes from your Object code, the
Objects can be re-submitted for approval.
<p><b><i>Viewpoints</i></b>
<p>Extra viewpoints associated with objects can cause confusion. They show
up in the viewpoint list just like viewpoints that are part of the world.
It's hard to predict where an owner will place an Object. Quite likely
a viewpoint in an object will cause a viewer using it to beam into a wall,
or some other inconvenient position.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><i>Lights</i></b>
<p>The VRML worlds in Cybertown are thoughtfully lit to look their best.
Extra lights in an Object can light a world too brightly, and make it appear
washed out. Also, extra lighting is one of the worst performance drains
in 3D applications. Too many lights will make slower computers bog and
lag. Even though some lights are acceptable in specific situations, please
use them sparingly, out of respect for your fellow Cybertonians.
<ul>
<li>
DirectionalLights are strictly forbidden. Even though DirectionalLights
cause little performance drain, they affect all objects in a world, regardless
of distance. Extra DirectionalLights tend to cause worlds to appear washed
out.</li>

<li>
Pointlights and SpotLights are acceptable in Objects such as lamps, where
they a functional part of the Object. If you include one of these type
of lights, you must also include a switch, so users can turn off the light.
These sorts of lights quickly cause slower computers to perform poorly.</li>
</ul>
<b><i>NavigationInfo and Backgrounds</i></b>
<p>These are less important nodes to avoid. Contact will simply ignore
them if the are part of an Object or Avatar. In some rare situations though,
they can cause problems. Please avoid using them.
<p><b><i>Inlines</i></b>
<p>We ask that Objects do not contain Inlines for two reasons.
<ul>
<li>
Each time an Inline is loaded, the browser needs to make another http call.
Too many separate connections competing for bandwidth can cause a variety
of problems. In designing Cybertown, we avoid using Inlines whenever possible
for this reason, and ask that you do also.</li>

<li>
We hope that Cybertown will be around for a long time. Inlines in Objects
can lead to broken links, and errors as people change service providers,
or get busy an forget to maintain a set of files. Help us avoid this possible
problem in the future. Upload all your code, and we will maintain the files
for you.</li>
</ul>
<b><i><font size=+2>Other Things to Consider</font></i></b>
<p>
<hr ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="50%">
<br><b><i>Animations</i></b>
<p>Be careful with animations.&nbsp; Looping animations that run continuously
are quite likely to cause some user's browser to bog.&nbsp; Objects containing
too many looping animations, or a very complex shape that is continuously
animated may be rejected.
<p>If you choose to use animations in your Objects, please make them the
so that they can be turned off , or are triggered by a user click.&nbsp;
If you would like to give an animation the appearance of a constantly running
animation, you can use a VisibilitySensor to turn the animation off when
the Object is out of the user's view.
<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br>Advanced Tip:
<br>To use a VisibilitySensor, as mentioned above:&nbsp; ROUTE&nbsp; the
isActive EventOut of a VisibilitySensor to the set_enabled EventIn of the
clocks that run your animations.&nbsp;&nbsp; The VisibilitySensor should
be in the same grouping node as your Object.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
will disable the clock when the Object is outside the user's view, and
stop the animation.&nbsp;&nbsp; When tha Object again enters the user's
view, the clock will be re-enabled anf the animation will begin again.</blockquote>

<p><b><i>External Links</i></b>
<p>For the same reasons we ask that you avoid Inlines, please avoid using
Anchors or other nodes linked to sources outside Cybertown. Creating Objects
that are spurious links to a web page is strongly discouraged. If you have
an especially interesting and beneficial application, feel free to run
it by the Mall staff. A special exception <i>might </i>be made. Otherwise
avoid external links.
<p><b><i>Appropriate Scale</i></b>
<p>Objects created for Cybertown should be scaled to look correct in Cybertown
environments. Exacting scale is not mandatory, in fact you might consider
making Objects slightly (25%) bigger than in real life. Cybertown environments
tend to be designed slightly larger to make navigation easier. Objects
that are too big, or too small will be rejected, but can be re-scaled and
resubmitted.
<p><b><i>No Big Objects</i></b>
<p>The Object system in Cybertown is not created to accommodate large objects
such as additional rooms for houses, very large trees, etc. A good rule
of thumb, is that any Object larger than 3 meters in any dimension is too
big.
<p><b><i>File size</i></b>
<p>The following limits on file sizes are intended to keep download time
in a reasonable range. Also, the limit on VRML file sizes is intended to
represent a reasonable complexity. If an Object is too complex, it will
bog and lag users computers. Please use good judgment for the sake of your
fellow Cybertonians.
<ul>
<li>
VRML files should be no larger than 40k</li>

<li>
Texture files should be no more than 20k, and should be 128 x 128 pixels
for maximum efficiency</li>

<li>
Sound files should be no larger than 20k</li>

<li>
the cumulative size of all of an Object's files should not exceed 60k</li>
</ul>
Also please remember to gzip your VRML files.
<p><b><i>Position</i></b>
<p>All objects should be positioned so they rest on the ground.
<p>In Cybertown, the center of a SharedObject (&lt;0 0 0>) in local coordinates
is NOT the bottom of the object. Shared Objects are placed 1.75 meters
above the ground. The bottom of a SharedObject must be placed at &lt;0
-1.75 0> in local coordinates.
<p>This is a little tricky.
<p>Look at the example below. It is a floor standing fan, which was uploaded
as an object.
<p><img SRC="place.jpg" height=270 width=456>
<p>First, remember that coordinates are relative.
<ul>
<li>
The fan has a set of coordinates in the .wrl file that defines the fan.
These coordinates are called <i>local coordinates</i>.</li>

<li>
The world in which the fan Object will be placed has it's own set of coordinates
. These are <i>global coordinates</i>.</li>

<li>
The browser determines where to put the fan, by moving the &lt;0 0 0> coordinate
of the <i>local coordinates </i>to fan's position expressed as a <i>global
coordinate</i>. The the browser draws the fan.</li>
</ul>
Second, remember that:
<ul>
<li>
When an Object is loaded into a world in Cybertown, it is placed 1.75 meters
off the floor, or at ' <i>+1.75 y </i>'.</li>

<li>
This is so that when you beam to the Object, your viewpoint remains at
eye level (+1.75 y). Not at 0 y, or floor level.</li>

<li>
This is a <i>global coordinate</i>.</li>
</ul>
Third, for the fan to work well as an Object:
<ul>
<li>
The &lt;0 0 0> of the fan's <i>local coordinates</i> must be in the middle
of the fan blades, NOT at the base of the fan.</li>

<li>
Viewed as a VRML file, and not in Cybertown as an Object, the bottom of
the fan will hang below the floor, with the base at -1.75 y.</li>
</ul>
Combine all this together and you get this logic:
<ul>
<li>
The base of the fan in local coordinates is at -1.75 y.</li>

<li>
When the fan is viewed in Cybertown as an Object, it is placed at + 1.75
y.</li>

<li>
(-1.75 y ) + (+1.75 y) = 0 y</li>

<li>
The base of the fan rests on the floor.</li>
</ul>
This concept is equally important for Objects which would naturally
<i>not
</i>rest
on the floor (such as a wall hanging picture). Cybertown uses this positioning
to place Objects properly in the displays, in the Mall. Poorly positioned
Objects will look funny on display and most likely not sell well. Please
make certain that the bottom of your object, is at y = -1.75.
<p><b><i>Copyrighted Material</i></b>
<p>Any Object containing material copyrighted by anyone other than the
person submitting the object will be rejected. We ask that our users respect
other peoples creative rights, just as we respect the creative rights of
our users.
