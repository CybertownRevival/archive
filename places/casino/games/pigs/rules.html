<h2><img src="images/sdot.gif">Frequently Asked Questions<img src="images/sdot.gif"></h2> 
<b>Q.  Why I am not able to view or play the game?</b><br> 
A.  You might have to check the preferences section in your browser to make sure 
that the option to view Java applets is turned on, or your browser may be 
incapable of showing Java applets.<br><br> 

<p><b>Q.  I've noticed that snouters and leaning jowlers don't appear that 
often. Why is that?</b><BR> 
A.  This game plays just like the real Pass the Pigs game. The odds of when a 
player would actually roll a leaning jowler or a snouter were calculated and 
incorporated into this game.<br><br> 
 
<b>Q.  I just got an oinker and it only shows that I currently have zero points, 
but it didn't wipe out the points before that. Why not?</b><BR> 
A.  Just like the real game, this game will only wipe out your current points. 
You do have zero points, but there is no need to change all of your points in 
your previous rounds to zero. <br><br> 
 
<b>Q.  The computer just beat me again, does it cheat?</b><BR> 
A.  No.  Many players lose because they can't do math or get too emotional during the game.  The 
computer does not have these problems and is therefore a tough opponent.  You can change the computer level by clicking on the Options button.<br><br> 

<b>Q.  In the real game you can "Hog Call" and get points by guessing the roll an opponent will get before they roll.  How do you do that in this game?</b><BR> 
A.  That is an optional rule which is not included in this game.  Real pigs players stick to the basics.<br><br>
