<h2 align=center>General Rules!</h2>

<p>Cybertown is a <b>family-oriented town</b> that includes children among its
visitors, so a Club must be respectful by not allowing pornography,
sexually-explicit links or encouraging crime or attacks against other
people. Bigotry, racism, hatred, profanity, defamatory or harrassing
behavior of any kind will not be accepted in the Clubs. Clubs may also
not violate copyrights or provide instructional information about
illegal activities.
<br>
When chatting in the Clubs, all Constitutional rules apply.
