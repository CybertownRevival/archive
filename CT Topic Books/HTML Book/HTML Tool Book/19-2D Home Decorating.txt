<font color=coral>When you have completed the coding you would like to use,click onto <br><font color=white>

<P>Now open the same file (2dhome.txt)and do the File Save as again....this time...save it as <font color=yellow>2dhome.html</p><font color=coral>
<P>By saving the files both ways,you can edit the .txt file and/or the .html file if you have a program that will allow for html editing.I use Notepad as it is easy.</p>
