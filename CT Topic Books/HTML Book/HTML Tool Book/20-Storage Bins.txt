<P>As you can see,my storage bins each has a different gif file next to all of them and also my bin names have sparkles.</p>Take a quick trip to my home to see the bins and also the full 2d Home Decor:</p>

<P>Remember to keep the filesize down when adding an image file to your bins...too large a file will make your 2d Home area to cluttered looking.A smaller file will look organized.You can also use different images files for each bin to snazz it up.</p>
<P>Holiday's is the time I like as can have fun decorating all over again!</p>
<font color=yellow>
<P>SAVE YOUR CODING so after you decorate for the holidays,you can put the code back!</p><font color=white>
<P>Thank you for taking the time to read this manual.I wish you the best and happy 2D Home Decorating!</p>
