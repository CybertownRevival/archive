<b>Lesson #6 - How to make a link</b><br>
<hr>
<p>
To make a link to another web page you have <br>
to have the correct URL for the page you want <br>
to hyperlink to. Normally the link will show in <br>
your browser go to URL window when you are <br>
on that web page.<p>
<XMP><A HREF="http://www.horse-feathers.com">Art</A></XMP>
<A HREF="http://www.horse-feathers.com">Art</A><p>
When people click on <u>Art</u>, the link goes <br>
directly to the web site. Remember to include <br>
the quotes, or it won't work. The <XMP></A></XMP> <br>
is the closing for all links. Please do not forget it. <br>
This link will open directly inside the message board. <p>
If we want the new link to open another browser <br>
window so the viewer will stay connected to <br>
Cybertown. The Target="new" command will <br>
open a new browser window. You have to put <br>
the new address in between the first quotes <br>
replacing http://horse-feathers.com be sure to <br>
include including all the quotes.<br>
<XMP><a href="http://horse-feathers.com" target="new">Art</a></XMP> 
<a href="http://horse-feathers.com" target="new">Art</a>
