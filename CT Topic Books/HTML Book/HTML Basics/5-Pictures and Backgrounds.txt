Lesson #7 -  Add Pictures & Backgrounds  <br>
<hr>
Adding a picture to your message is easy.  First you <br>
need to know the pictures location. If you have <br>
imported a picture into a picture frame or into <br>
a photo book in Cybertown then it is simply a matter <br>
of opening the photo book or picture frame.  Then <br>
right click on the picture you want in your message. <br>
I choose 'copy image location' to get an address <br>
for the location of the picture file. Diferent browsers <br>
give you diferent choices. Or you can use a picture <br>
you have uploaded to your own web site. <p>
Here is the basic code needed to get a picture on <br>
your page. Put your art's address inbetween the quotes. <br>
<XMP><img src="here"></XMP><P>

<b>Very Important Note:</b><p>
Linking to someone elses picture on their web site <br>
without their permission is not a good thing to do. <br>
#1) When they make page changes to their web <br>
site your link to their art gets broken. <br>
#2) When they change their art on their web site, <br>
again your link to their art gets broken. All of <br>
which makes your web page look bad. <br>
#3) Not to mention using someone elses bandwidth <br>
is uncool and slows down the loading of your webpage. <br>
Plus it can get you in a heap of trouble $ wise. <p>
<hr>
Backgrounds<br>
<hr>
Backgrounds are done much the same way. The code <br>
is a little different, but still simple. Here is the code. <br>
Remember to replace my art's address with your <br>
art's address inbetween the quotes. <br>
<XMP><body background="here"></XMP><p>
<XMP><body background="http://www.cybertown.com/dbimages/BK/o0/01/a7/10/a/pic_7_1.jpg"></XMP><p>
<body background="http://www.cybertown.com/dbimages/BK/o0/01/a7/10/a/pic_7_4.gif">
<img src="http://www.cybertown.com/dbimages/BK/o0/01/a7/10/a/pic_7_1.jpg"><p>
TIP: Changing your backgrounds in a topic book is a little <br>
tricky sense they already have a predefined background. <br>
Messing with that code may not be a good idea. I have <br>
broken a few topic books and had to delete them by <br>
using unacceptable code. So making a large picture <br>
with writing on it can make it seem as if you have a <br> 
different back ground. Keep the file size as small as you <br>
can so it loads fast. Happy HTMLing In Cybertown!!! <br>
