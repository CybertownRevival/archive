<b>Lesson #3 - Font Colors</b><br>
<hr>
Color HTML Codes for Messages - Here are a<br>
few basic color names to make the font <br>
a different color like: <p>
"blue", "red", "yellow", <br>
"green", "purple", "orange", <br>
"aqua", "pink", "brown", "black", <br>
"white", "grey",<p>
Or use the exact color code the list is <br>
to long to list here. I will use blue as <br>
the example.<p>
<XMP><font color="blue">Type Here</font></XMP>
<font color="blue">Type Here</font><p>
NOTE: Make sure you can read the font on <br>
the background you are putting it on. <br>
Example: Black is a poor choice for a <br>
message to all as some people are still <br>
using a black background. and they will <br>
think that there is no message there.  <br>
You can put any color in. Make sure you <br>
always close your /font codes at the end <br>
of the colored area.<P>
