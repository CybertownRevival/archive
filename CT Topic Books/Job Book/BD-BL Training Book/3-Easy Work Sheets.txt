Checking resident's status is done at the block level<BR>
in 2D mode. The fastest way to do this is to change modes.<BR>
Go to the control Panel in the menu on the right.<BR>
1. Before you start, you press your [My Info] button.<BR>

( ) Blaxxun Contact (3D Plugin)<BR>
4. Then select the [update] button.<P>
Now you can go from house to house zip-a-de-do-da<BR> 
Then you can change it back when you are done.<BR>
Blaxxun Contact (Jave) is the default, choose it <BR>
if you are checking for bad pictures.<P>
<h3>Fast Work Sheets</h3><p>
Scroll down from your home at the block level and select<BR>
your resident's house list and copy it to make your work<BR>
sheet. You can visit any house in your block from that<BR>
list. The Last Access dates of your residents should <BR>
 be added to your report. You select the <BR>
whole list as i said then right click on it choose <BR>
[copy]. Open note pad or word pad on your computer and <BR>
select [edit] and choose [paste] you now have your work <BR>
sheet. This will help you when it comes time to do your <BR>
report<p>
<h3>Sample Work Sheet</h3><p>
<p>Your important information here is House Name which<br>
you already have it your list. Then the Last Access Date<br>
and nic. These three things will tell you all you<br>
really need to know about your resident. When you find a<br>
resident with 60+ exp note the Resident's Name these<br>
residents you will hope to meet as you move around the<br>
block later. But right now you are on a block run<br>
grabbing information and speed gets the job done fast so<br>
you can have fun later. My list looks like this. I put a dot <br>
by each house as I check it so I know where I am if I am <br>
interrupted. <p>

<strong>NOTE: </strong>I make a list down here of the oldest houses<BR>
This is a huge time saver when Real Life gets busy.<BR> 
I can message  and check images and see if Free spaces <BR>
need updated and be done in 5 minutes. Next time I <BR>
might check for new people.<p>
I always keep a record of every thing I do then I have it <br>
ready for reports when I need it.It is simply a cut and paste or count.<p>
I don't have to worry about reports I can pop a report in <br>
a couple of minutes and now so can you. Try it!<br>
<P>Most hoods require that the BL fill out a block report at a set day<BR>
given each week. They usually consist of: new resident count, upcoming<BR>
and ongoing events, questions concernes etc. Although BL Reports vary<BR>
from hood to hood, it is still imperative that you complete and send<BR>
them in, so that your ND knows how good of a job you do, and so that<BR>
they have a nice organized record of the ongoings of your block.<BR>
