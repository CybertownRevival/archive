<P><strong>The Welcome Message</strong><BR>
One of the most important task to be done is <BR>
welcoming new residents. Currently policy is that all <BR>
new residents need to be sent a "Welcome Message" <BR>
within and no later than 48 hours of moving to your <BR>
block. Introduce yourself, make them feel at home. <BR>
of some of the things you want to consider in your <BR>
messages. You may also write your own.
<P>Keep your messages brief but informative. Always <BR>
teach them a little something in each message if you <BR>
can. Put your message in their Inbox and their Message <BR>
Board so you can tell you messaged them and so can <BR>
your BL and ND. And most importantly your new resident <BR>
might find it and know that you care.

Hi All,<BR>
So many new people this week it takes me back to <BR>
when I first entered Cybertown and was looking for a <BR>
mirror so I could view my Avatar. LOL!!! And I was <BR>
serious!!  A great guy told me that I did not need <BR>
a mirror. That if I right clicked on the screen and chose <BR>
view Avatar I could see my Avatar. Well, I felt much <BR>
better after all the work I went to get one.  Oh! <BR>
Just use the My Info button for that and choose <BR>
Avatar or you can use the right left scroll buttons <BR>
when in 3D chat and move all the way to the right <BR>
and find the Avatar thing there.<BR>
Happy Blue Avatars to Ya!  :o)<BR>

the Flea Market find their Nick Name in list of people <BR>
