<font size="3">
<p>Recruiting is a very personalized talent.  Everyone<BR>
goes about recruiting residents to their block a different<BR>
way.  Some people offer jobs (CA) and require them to move<BR>
to the block, while others just brag about the fun and<BR>
activities in their block.  Some even pay people to move<BR>
to their block.  But the objective always remains the<BR>
same... get citizens to move to their block.<BR>
