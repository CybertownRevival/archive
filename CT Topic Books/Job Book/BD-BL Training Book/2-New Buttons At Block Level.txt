<P><img SRC="http://www.cybertown.com/images/buttons/bconfig.gif" ALT="Configure" width="116" height="16"> Configure button - is what the Block <br>
Leader will see in the Message boards. It can be used <br>
by the Block Leader. The Block Leader needs to make <br>
sure the graphic links used here are connected to <br>
the Colony website and not to other web sites. As Block<BR>Leader you could come in one day and find the Message <br>
board graphics broken or gone.  You can capture the <br>
graphics by right clicking on them and saving them to <br>
your hard drive, as a Gif or Jpg. Then upload them <br>
into a Photo Book to get them into Cybertown and <br>
copy the new link that was created by the Photo <br>
Book to your message board, in place of the old link. <br> 
You can find Photo Book at the Homebuildres.<p>
<img SRC="http://www.cybertown.com/images/buttons/bgroupmesa.gif"
ALT="Message To ALL" width="116" height="16"> Messages To All button. Here <BR>you can post new messages or forward messages to <BR>
all the residents of your block, one of your first <BR>
tasks is to introduce yourself, and the Message <BR>
to All button is perfect for that. You should also post <BR>
to the block board a copy of what you post to all. 
<p><img SRC="http://www.cybertown.com/images/buttons/bupdate.gif"
ALT="Update" width="116" height="16">  Update button - is used by the<BR> Block Leader and Block Deputies with Block Leader's <br>
aproval. The special features of the Update button <BR>
are used by the Neighborhood Leader or Colony Deputy <BR>
to set up the original block layout of homes. Block <BR>
Deputies are restricted to resetting the Free spaces <BR>
as needed.If you leave too many open they will fill up <BR>
with one timers. You want to keep <B>2-3</B> free spaces only <BR>
per block. You want residents that keep coming back <BR>
and who want to have fun on the block.  Also, add<br>
 a little personality... spread them out and show your<BR>
 BL and even the ND your dedication.<BR>
<br>Never leave Free spaces on roads or the scenery. <br>
You don't want houses on roads rivers or trees.  You <br>
are to keep one or two clear spots as reserve spaces.  <br>
Sometimes it is necessary to bring in more staff and <br>
having a couple of closed spaces assures that this can <br>
happen quickly in an emergency situation.<br>
<br>Here I count the total number of residents and the <br>
number of  free spaces, and put that in my notes. <br>
With all of the necessary information in hand when <BR>
it is time to fill out the Weekly Report. It is not <BR>
hard at all just a matter of cut and paste and add <BR>
a few notes as needed. <br>
<br><img SRC="http://www.cybertown.com/images/buttons/bcheck.gif" ALT="Check" width="116"
height="16">  Check button - is used to check<BR>resident's 2D images. This is one of the easiest jobs and<BR>most forgotten jobs. And it takes only a few seconds to <BR>
make your new residents very happy to see their picture. <BR>
If the image is waiting approval, there will be a check <BR>
mark in the locked box. If everything is ok simply <BR>
unlock the image by clicking on the image then the <BR>
check box to remove the check mark. Images should <BR>
be checked daily. To check images you need to be <BR>
at the block level. Images must not be offensive, <BR>
they must be gif, jpg or jpeg format. If the image <BR>
is too big won't upload. At the block level you <BR>
click on the button and then page up and down to <BR>
view the pictures. <p>

alt="baccess.gif (701 bytes)"> Access Rights button - is not <BR>
visable to Block Deputies. The Access Rights button <BR>
is for Block Leaders only. The Block Leader should <BR>
make sure that there are no boxes in the lower table <BR>
that are checked unless the Neighborhood Leader <BR>
specifys otherwise. Checking one of these boxes might <BR>
allow access by people outside of the block staff. So <BR>
don't check or uncheck them without orders to do so.<BR>
In Access Rights the Block Leader should check to be <BR>
sure only those authorized officials are listed. Access <BR>
Rights can be dangerous if misused. Be careful <BR>
that BDs do not have access to this function. Never <BR>
add a name without permission from a ND or NL <BR>
Neighborhood Deputy or Neighborhood Leader. 
<P>If you are the Block Leader and are adding a new BD, <BR>
please notify the Neighborhood Leader or your Block's <BR> 
Neighborhood Deputy. Give the nickname of the new<BR>BD and other information such as email and ICQ addresses. <BR>
Also the perspective BD needs to have filled out a job <BR>
application form, have been interviewed and OKed for <BR>
hire. In most Colonys BLs have the right to hire and <BR>
train their own BD Staff but they should communicate <BR>
with the Neighborhood Deputy or Neighborhood Leader <BR>
prior to hiring.
