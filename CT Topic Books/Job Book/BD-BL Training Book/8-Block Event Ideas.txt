<P><h3><a name="w09">Activity Level</a></h3>
As Block Leader it is your responsability to make <BR>
the block a happy place to live and that means to <BR>
raise the Activity Level and keep the residents <BR>
happy and interested in events in Cybertown so <BR>
they come in often and stay active. 
<P>NOTE: A Few Activity Secrets. <BR>
1) Welcome your residents as fast as possible as <BR>
soon as they come to the block. You must make <br>
them feel at home so they will keep coming in.<BR>
2) Keeping too many Free spaces on the map actually <BR>
lowers your activity. So keep only 3 Free spaces <BR>
open and check it often.<BR> 
3) Posting messages on all the boards helps.<BR>
4) Getting residents to put 2D pictures on their <BR>
homes helps. Plus it gives the block a lively look. <BR>
5) Pretty Message boards will also help. <BR>
6) The more experience points on the block the higher <BR>
the Activity rate. 
<P>Why do we need activities, parties, trivia, auctions <BR>
and events to raise our activity level?  Have you <BR>
ever seen a full block with no pictures, no messages, <BR>
no links, and no one around. It is like a ghost town <BR>
with the ghosts missing. Not a great place to hang <BR>
out and a dull place to live.
<P>An active block is a great place to live. Messages <BR>
friends hanging out and chatting. Parties, Auctions, <BR>
trivia, prizes, awards, pretty pictures, exciting <BR>
message boards, a real fun place to be.

<P><a name="w14"><strong>Start a 3D House Tour List</strong></a> - So people coming in <BR>
to the block can see what beautiful homes there are in <BR>
your block. Ask residents to message you to get their <BR>
house on the Tour of Beautiful 3D Homes List for <BR>
your block. You can post your list on the Block and <BR>
the Hood Message Boards.
<P>Many Sites to see in Cybertown - List your favorite <BR>
places and have others list theirs back to you.<BR>
<BR><a name="w15"><strong>Cybertown Surf-in Party</strong></a> - You and your friends <BR>
surf around all over Cybertown each person showing <BR>
off his or her favorite places or houses.  This Party <BR>
requires that everyone have ICQ so no one gets lost. <BR>
Because this party is not confined to the block.

<a name="w16"><strong>Scavenger Hunt</strong></a> - Oh! This can be exciting. Don't <BR>
make the items too hard to find or too expensive. <BR>
The items should be of a general nature and not a <BR>
specific item.  Such as a Staff not a Red Devil's Staff. <BR>
Or you could send them around Cybertown after <BR>
information so they get to know the place better.  <BR>
Always make it fair so every one has a chance. <BR>
Let your imagination run wild on this one.  <BR>
Special note: Every one needs ICQ so they can keep <BR>
in contact.
<P><strong>Final Note:</strong><BR>
Be sure that you keep in constant contact with your <BR>
BL and or your ND and let him/her know what you <BR>
are doing. Most BLs and NDs will do the same for <BR>
you. So make your Colony proud and be the shinning <BR>
BD Welcome Wagon Host or Hostess of your block, <BR>
and above all have some fun parties.  You will soon <BR>
find yourself getting a permotion.<P>

This book is the result of many hours of hard work I <BR>
want to thank my many BDs, BLs, NDs, NLs, and CD <BR>
helpers who provided the need that inspired me to <BR>
finish this book.<BR>
