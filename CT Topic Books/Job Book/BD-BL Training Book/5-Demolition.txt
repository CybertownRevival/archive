<h3><a name="D6">Block Heroes or Block Security</a></h3><p>
ICQ has proven to be a fast form of communication for <BR>
staff members and most of the CT staff have it. You are<BR>
the protectors of the block so residents will look to <BR>
you as a leader to help them when they have a problem. <BR>
You may be asked to come to a home where an intruder is<br>
causing problems. You need to be able to<br>instruct the people involved as to what to do. Or to go<br>into 3D mode yourself and save the chat and call Security<br>as you try to calm the situation. <br>
<br>If you keep a cool head you can handle the situation <br>
easily and will be their Hero. <br>
<br>Here is what should you do if some one is using bad <br>
language or flooding? I will list the chain of events in <br>
order so that you could you have a good useable chat <br>
log ready to send to security when security arrives on <br>
the scene.<br>
<br>1. Clear your Public Chat Log at the first sign <br>
of trouble or before you enter a room in 3D.<p>
2. Get the person to talk about himself as much as <br>
possible. Always be polite and ask the person to stop <br>
three times.<p>3. Now prepare to call Security.  Undock the public <br>
chat window and set scroll lock to off. Go to the <br>
Security Inbox is found at Jump Gate. Briefly tell <br>
Security the intruders nicknane and what is wrong. <br>
Give your nickname and location or if at a home <br>
give the complete address in 2 ways: <br>
The Colony/Neighborhood/Block/House name and <br>
http://www.Cybertown.com/home/nickname of <br>
person's house where the disturbance is taking place.<p>
4. Now copy and paste all relevant text to a text file <br>
then start copying the chat logs and pasting it to the <br>
security inbox. Use the same name on all logs you <br>
send. <p>
5. When security arrives you already have what you <br>
need to catch him fast. Believe me action will be taken <br>
and you will be the hero of the block.<p>
Get ICQ or Learn where the staff people of your Colony <BR>
gather. Then you can just go there and ask for an<BR>
ND or CD or NL to get the help you need.<P>
