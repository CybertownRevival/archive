<h3>BD in Training for Block Leader</h3>
<p>You must learn it all to be a good Block Leader. A <br>
good Block Deputy should be able to take over in <br>
case the Block Leader is gone unexpectedly. You <br>
should have read the previous pages so you already <br>
understand the tools and know how to use them. <br>
You have also read the tricks to making the job fast <br>
and easy. Try them out and have fun.<br>
<P><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong><br>
As Block Leader you are responsible for the <br>
whole block this is your domain your Message <br>
Boards you are in control. If you don't know <br>
HTML ask an ND for help with your Message <br>
Board or hire an HTML Wizard BD to help you <br>
out. It is exciting to be your own boss but it carries <br>
a price. You are responsible for the health and <br>
maintenance of the block if the block activity goes <br>
down and the block falls into disrepair you will be <br>
fired. So if you have lazy BDs or no BDs then you <br>
must do their jobs until you get some. 
<P>Even then you must keep check on your BDs to <br>
see that they are working and sending you reports. <br>
If they don't know how to do something you must <br>
teach them. Always be polite no matter how much <br>
you want to strangle a person. That is how it is in <br>
management. The higher the position the more polite <br>
you must become. Because you are a representative <br>
of your Block your Hood and your Colony.  And to <br>
any newcomer walking in to the Plaza you represent <br>
the best of Cybertown.
<P>By now you should know all the tools. One of the <br>
things you must do as a Block Leader is hire some <br>
BDs so you need to write an ad to post in the <br>
Employment Office Message Board and to place on <br>
other Message Boards around the Neighborhood and <br>
in the Block Message to All once a week. Here are <br>
some ideas or you can also make up your own ads.  <br>
Just explain what you need or what the job <br>
requirements are. Some people want to know <br>
up front what they will be expected to do.</p>

Feel free to make up your own, but remember even <br>
warning letters are to be polite and as positive as <br>
possible. There may be some reason why a person is <br>
not logging in or being inactive. Always remember to <br>
thank your employees for their time and dedication. <br>
We are all here on a voluntary basis, and time is a <br>
precious thing.<br>
<br><a name="blt12"><strong>Subject: Employee Not Logging in</strong></a><br>
Hello (Employee's name) <br>
Lately I have noticed that you have not been able <br>
to login on a regular basis. I hope all is well with <br>
you, and that you are not having technical difficulties <br>
getting here. We need to get an active Leader very <br>
soon, if we do not here from you with in one week <br>
we will have to let you go. We will name you as a <br>
BD here for another week, in order to hold a position <br>
for you. After that I am afraid we will have to let you <br>
go altogether unless we hear from you soon. If you <br>
are no longer interested in your job, please lets us <br>
know right away.  Upon your return, depending <br>
on what the problem has been, perhaps we can <br>
reinstate you, or find you a new job.<br>
Kind Regards, <br>

<br><a name="blt13"><strong>Subject: Inactivity Employee</strong></a><br>
Hello Nickname(Title),<br>
Although you are able to login on a regular basis, <br>
you do not do much for your Block. Part of the job <br>
as a Leader here is to message your residents <br>
regularly, a Message To All button  makes this an <br>
easy task and to organize meetings and activities for <br>
them. You are also expected to check images and <br>
clean dead houses on a regular basis. You are <br>
expected to communicate with your co-workers and <br>
team members.  If you feel you can not do these <br>
things, please have the courtesy of resigning from your <br>
position, so we can hire a more interested person.  <br>
If you have had some difficulties in RL that have been <br>
hindering you from being more active or if you don't <br>
understand how to do these tasks, please let me know <br>
so.  I can have someone help you. <br>
Kind Regards,<br>
Thanks -Your BL <br>
