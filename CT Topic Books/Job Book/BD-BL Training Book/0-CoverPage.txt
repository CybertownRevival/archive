<p><h2>Block Deputy & Block Leader Tools</h2>
<p>Becoming a Block Deputy is a important first step in your <br>
career path here in Cybertown. You are representing your <br>
Block. It is very important that you set a good example. <br>
Be friendly and helpful to all citizens. Remember behind those <br>
avatars are real people, and they come from many different <br>
cultures and ethical backgrounds, what we may take for <br>
granted as the norm they may not. You are there to help the <br>
residents of your block, try to answer their questions. Help <br>
residents learn how to use their Inboxs, and all of the <br>
different Message boards. <br>
<br>Be a Teacher by example, set your inbox and message board <br>
to except HTML tags, use some of the available tools you can <br>
find on the different Message boards. Read your message <br>
boards.  Bring the best information and party invitations back <br>
to your Block. This will keep your residents happy.  </p>
<p>As a new Block Deputy (BD) your first task is to upload a <br>
graphic to decorate your home and  put the letters BD after <br>
your name, this is so that residents know who you are, and <br>
so they can find you if they need your assistance. </p>
<p>The next thing is to send out a message introducing yourself, <br>
letting the residents know who you are and that you are there to <br>
help.  Establish that first line of communication. Set up a time <br>
that you will always be in your home so residents can reach you. <br>
It is a good idea to work this out with the rest of the team <br>
so there will always be someone around to help new <br>
residents.<br>
<br>Important:  Be sure you check with your assigned BL before <br>
doing any of the following tasks. Remember what follows is <br>
only a guide. The tasks you are assigned depends on what your <BR>
Block Leader needs you to do.  A good Block Deputy should be <BR>
able to take over the Block Leaders position at any time.  <br>
