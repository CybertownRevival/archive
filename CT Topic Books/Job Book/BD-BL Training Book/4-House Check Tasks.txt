<p>The best little trick!  When you are making your rounds a <br>
lot of time is wasted waiting for the chat programs to load. <br>
If you turn off the chat modes in your house you will also <br>
turn off the the chat mode for yourself. Now when you go <br>
to a site in CT the chats will not load. To do this you click <br>
on the My Info button and choose Personal. Click on the <br>
radio button marked no chat. Remember you and house are <br>
in the same mode so don't go on a no chat round while you <br>
wait for people to show up for your party. Don't forget to <br>
change your setting back to the setting you want afterwards. <br>
<br><strong>2D House Picture</strong><br>
<br>You should check to see if a picture is interfering with the <br>
other parts of the page by way of size or shape. If there <br>
is a problem with the picture try to make a constructive <br>
suggestion. If it is a picture that is not allowed in Cybertown. <br>
Then message the resident to please choose a better <br>
picture. But do not unlock it.<br>
<br><strong>Links</strong><br>
<br>Links can be found in several places on the page. First <br>
the active links. The home owner home page URL is right <br>
underneath their experience. Often people forget to put <br>
the http:// in front and the browser tries to open up the a <br>
page on the CT server and doesn't find it. This is true for <br>
all active links. Links to other CT 3D pages are not a good <br>
idea as the server does not allow more than one 3D chat <br>
connection on a browser with netscape. The Links button <br>
exposes more active links. You can find active links is in <br>
the Information Box and the Message Boxes. The HTML <br>
is involved which you can't see directly so just check the <br>
links and if their is problem tell the owner. Make an offer <br>
to find help if that is appropriate. Inactive links are a little <br>
harder to check as you have to type the address into your <br>
browser. Always copy and paste it is important check the <br>
owner's spelling not yours. </p>
<p>Be sure to message the resident about any link problems <br>
or say you saw their web page and it was nice. Always <br>
compliment your residents and staff when ever possible. <br>
It is always appreciated.<br>
<br><strong>House Name</strong><br>
<br>House names make it easier to find peoples houses. Ever <br>
try to send some one to a house that has only a space for <br>
a name or a . it is not easy.  It makes a big difference to <br>
BLs and BDs in keepping track of residents. If you miss a <br>
house its usually a house without a name. Encourage the use <br>
of names. Of course certain names are not allowed. This is <br>
serious as you can't lock out the name short of deleting the <br>
house. Take immediate action. Report it to your BL or ND <br>
for imediate deletion if its really bad. <br>
<br><strong>Information Box</strong><br>
<br>Probably the most under used resource in CT. Its the only <br>
place you can let your personality show through. This is a bit <br>
much for new comers just trying to get their house in order <br>
but encouraging the better use of this facility later on is a good<br>
idea. They may need help with the HTML. If something is <br>
wrong here the owner probably knows about it so offer help. <br>
<br><strong>Message Boxes</strong><br>
<br>The Message boxes need to be set to accept HTML. The <br>
dates and number of the messages tells you something <br>
about the actively of the resident.  Some times the content <br>
will tell you if a BD or BL is at work or has been slacking. <br>
Or if someone is on vacation and when they will return.<p>
<strong>Last Access and Experience</strong><p>
The last access line is something that the Block Officers see <br>
when they enter a house. If you take the exp. points subtract <br>
50 then divide by five you get the number of visits the <br>
resident has made. Looking at the time past from when the <br>
resident immigrated to when he/she last accessed tells the <br>
rate of actively of the resident. <p>

<strong>Checking Inside the House</strong><p>
Cybertown is a family Chat in houses and out. It would not be <br>
good for a young child to come to a house where the Bot says <br>
nasty words or with nude pictures hanginig all over the walls. <br>
An adult BD or BL should be asigned to the task of in house <br>
checking. If you don't have one, ask your ND or NL for help. <br>
1. The Bot should be checked with normal speach, residents <br>
 name, hello, hi, bye, bots name, love, hate or whatever. <br>
2. In house pictures need checked. <br>
3. Topic books can be opened when in the house. So check <br>
them they are web sites that could have anything in them. <br>
4. Photo books can have many pages of 4 pictures each. <br>
5. Guest book also needs checked. <br>
6. Music box can also be checked.  <br>
7. Visit Counter needs checked. Yes it can be altered.<br>
If you find Bad pictures or a nasty web site link you need to <br>
contact your BL right away do not delay. It is important that <br>
the house and contents be destroyed thus destroying the bad <br>
objects inside.<br>
