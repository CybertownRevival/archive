<P>Read the Colony Message Board as often as possible to keep<BR>
up with events and answer any questions or suggestions that<BR>
have been posted. If you read a message that you feel is<BR>
inappropriate, copy the message and save it for future reference<BR>
(if needed), delete the message from the message board and put a<BR>
letter of warning in the inbox of the citizen that posted the message.<BR>
If necessary, give the citizen the information they need to point them<BR>
in the right direction. Example: If the citizen has posted a message of<BR>
complaint about a staff member, point them to the complaint form linked<BR>
in the message board or ask them to leave a message in the inbox of that<BR>
staff members superior. It is requested that each CD delete old mesages<BR>
to help with the daily flow of messages. Each time you read the Colony<BR>
Message Board, please try to delete 10 ( or more) old messages from the<BR>
bottom of the message board if possible. If you notice messages that are<BR>
duplicated, you can delete the older message. Try to keep the message board<BR>
trimmed to just 5 weeks worth of messages, unless they are important,<BR>
then let them scroll off.<BR>
