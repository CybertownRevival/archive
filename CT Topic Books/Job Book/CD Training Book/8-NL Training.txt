<P>For ease, you can make an NL information text file and save<BR>
it on your computer. When a new NL is hired or promoted, you can<BR>
then copy and paste the text in an email to them so that they know<BR>
exactly what is expected of them in their new position. You should<BR>
also inform them of the monthly colony meetings and what needs to<BR>
be reported at the meetings. Let the NL know that if they cannot<BR>
attend the meeting, they should ask an ND to attend in their place.<BR>
If an ND is not available, they should send you a report prior to<BR>
the meeting so that you can report for the neighborhood. Make sure<BR>
your NL is aware of the Colony Guidelines (you should also<BR>
familiarize yourself with these guidelines). Also be sure that the<BR>
NL inboxes the Training CD to setup a time to be trained. ALL NLs<BR>
should be trained within days after being hired.<BR>
