<P>
This position is given at the discretion of the CL, and is usually a C-staff<BR>
member of seniority and has been with the C-staff for an extended period of time and<BR>
is aware of the duties and challenges entailed with working at the colony level<BR>
(as it is a very demanding position). In the event that the CL is not present for<BR>
an extended period of time the DCL will be given the authority to make any critical<BR>
decisions that need to be made during that timeframe. This position will also be<BR>
given owner/moderator access on all egroups as well as other information concerning<BR>
the colony, this is done so that should access need to be added or removed in<BR>
a timely manner it can be done even if the CL is not available. One of the main duties<BR>
for the DCL is to prepare the house deletion list in a timely manner and present it<BR>
to IVN. The DCL can also do BackGround Checks and can also fill in for other CDs<BR>
wherever needed. The DCL will also be the one who is in charge of the Colony while the<BR>
Colony Leader is absent (ie:vaction)<BR>
