<font size="3">
<P> Unless a serious infraction had occured (something that<BR>
would require banishment from Cybertown), you should try to<BR>
give 3 warnings when their duties have been neglected. Obviously,<BR>
depending on the circumstance, this cannot always be done, but<BR>
you should always consult with your CL on problems with an NL.<BR>
When giving an NL a warning, keep a copy of the warning for future<BR>
reference or use. After 2 warnings and a third infraction, speak<BR>
with the CL with your concern on why the NL needs to be replaced<BR>
for the CL's input. Forward to the CL any warnings you have given<BR>
to the NL. Once it has been determined to replace the NL, email or<BR>
inbox the NL and cc to the CL. After an NL has been replaced, make<BR>
sure that they are removed from any access in the neighborhood<BR>
including the block access rights and the Change Rights Access.<BR>
<P>To hire a new NL, first check within the neighborhood for<BR>
deserving promotions within the ND staff. If there isn't an ND that<BR>
can be considred, you can speak with other NL's in Games for<BR>
recommendations of ND's within the Colony that may be deserving of<BR>
promotion and have them fill out applications. When you receive an<BR>
application from a perspective NL, speak with their current or<BR>
previous supervisor for input. When an NL has been selected, make<BR>
sure that they give sufficient notice to their previous job and that<BR>
their last supervisor is satisfied with this notice. Get with a<BR>
tooled CD or announce in the CD group that you need a BGC. Once a<BR>
clear BGC is received, you can proceed to hire the NL and put him in<BR>
access. Once a new NL is put in access, announce them on the<BR>
Games Colony Message Board and in the Neighborhood Message Board<BR>
where they will be working.<BR>
