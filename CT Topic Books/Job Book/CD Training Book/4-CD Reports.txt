<P>The CL expects a brief summary of events in your hoods<BR>
and your area of Colony work, if you have one. This should<BR>
be done monthly just prior to the colony meetings. Speak to<BR>
the CL DannyKing to ask him where to send them. Some of this<BR>
information will come out at the Colony meetings however the<BR>
report is still needed to highlight any specific issues you<BR>
are dealing with is needed to avoid mishaps in communication.<BR>
The important thing is that we build our team on openness and<BR>
good communication so that we can support one another and<BR>
develop the Colony. <BR>
