<P>Welcome to Games Colony and congratulations on your new<BR>
position here.  This training guide is here to help you learn<BR>
your new role as Colony Deputy.  Hopefully this guide will<BR>
also make the transition from Neighborhood Leader to Colony<BR>
Deputy smoother and less confusing for you. Sometimes the<BR>
line between NL and CD can be hard to establish because you<BR>
are now giving the NL duties that you have performed for so<BR>
long. You have worked hard in your neighborhood as NL and have<BR>
put a lot of time and effort into getting the neighborhood to<BR>
run smoothly and definitely deserve your new promotion.<BR>
<P>When you first became an NL, you brought your own ideas and<BR>
creativity into the neighborhood where you were working. Now<BR>
that you are a Colony Deputy, you need to remember that each NL<BR>
should be given the opportunity that you were given, to try new<BR>
things and implement some of their own ideas. Listen to their<BR>
ideas, you may learn something new. You can give them advice<BR>
and suggestions that will help guide them in the right direction<BR>
but let your NL's do their jobs. You are there to train, help<BR>
and guide them, not to perform their duties for them<BR>
