<P>After you have had security training, you will be given<BR>
security tools that will help you perform certain tasks in<BR>
the colony. Make sure that you keep up with any updated<BR>
Cybertown policies regarding security issues. Familiarize<BR>
yourself with the Unified Ban Policy (UBP) so that you<BR>
know the current standards on Banning & Gagging. Your<BR>
security tools will be used for the following reasons:<BR><BR><BR>
<P><a name="w18"><strong><font size="3" color=yellow>"Banning and Gagging"</font></strong></a></p>
<P>When you "Ban" or "Gag" a Cybertown citizen, make<BR>
sure to keep copies of any information such as screen shots,<BR>
logs, emails, etc. that gives the needed proof that the<BR>
citizen was disobeying Cybertown Policy or Law so that it<BR>
may be submitted to CT Security or CERB if requested.<BR><BR><BR>
<p><a name="w18"><strong><font size="3" color=yellow>"Background Checks"</font></strong></a></p> 
<P>Background Checks, (BCG's) must be done on any<BR>
perspective colony staff member from the rank of<BR>
Neighborhood Deputy and up for security reasons. The NL<BR>
in your assigned neighborhoods should request a security<BR>
check from you before hiring an ND. If you are away, an<BR>
NL may request a security check from another CD in the colony.<BR><BR><BR> 
<p><a name="w18"><strong><font size="3" color=yellow>"Deleting Homes with Inappropriate Material"</font></strong></a></p>
<P>Occasionally you will need to delete homes with<BR>
inappropriate material such as house names, inappropriate<BR>
images, bot/pet conduct, links, etc.  With Security Tools,<BR>
you can have the option to delete resident homes before the<BR>
31-day inactivity rule. It is a good idea to keep records of<BR>
all homes you need to delete due to inappropriate material.<BR>
Keep information such as, which neighborhood/block, house name,<BR>
resident name, what inappropriate material was found and any<BR>
other information you feel is necessary.<BR>
