<P>If you are going to be away for vacation or an extended<BR>
leave of absence for any reason, you must contact the CL as<BR>
soon as possible giving the beginning date of leave and the<BR>
date of return. Speak with other CD's and try to find someone<BR>
to cover your assigned neighborhoods while you are away and<BR>
inform the CL of which CD will be covering for you. Make sure<BR>
that the NL's of your assigned neighborhoods know the dates<BR>
that you will leave and return and who will be covering the<BR>
neighborhoods so that they know whom to contact for<BR>
assistance. Please add (VAC until date) to the end of your<BR>
house name so that resident and other staff know that you are<BR>
away and can look elsewhere for assistance if needed,<BR>
(example: (VAC until 9-01)). It would also be a good idea to<BR>
put a message in your personal message board with the subject<BR>
"Vacation" and in the body of the message, give the date of<BR>
your return and who will be covering for you.<BR>
