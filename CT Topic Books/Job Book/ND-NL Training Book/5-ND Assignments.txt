<p align="left"></p><p align="left"><font face="Arial">As a neighborhood grows it can become increasingly
 difficult to keep up with staff changes, training requirements, organizing social events and so on. To
help assist in this, some neighborhoods </font>
<font color="#EAE7A6" face="Arial">assign areas of responsibility</font>
<font face="Arial"> to ND's. Although it is generally accepted that </font>
<font color="#EAE7A6" face="Arial">ALL</font>
<font face="Arial"> are available to help each other, to actually give a name as </font>
<font color="#EAE7A6" face="Arial">another point of contact and reference</font>
<font face="Arial"> can reassure that tasks are actually addressed and that support is available. To what
 extent this is all done is entirely up to the NL and how they wish to run their hood. </font>
 <font color="#EAE7A6" face="Arial"><strong>The following information is suggestion only.</strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Some neighborhoods </font>
<font color="#EAE7A6" face="Arial">cross reference their assignments</font>
<font face="Arial">. For example, an ND takes on a particular column, row, or group of blocks and therefore
 is responsible for </font>
<font color="#EAE7A6" face="Arial">coordinating those blocks.</font>
<font face="Arial"> The assigned ND becomes a particular point of reference & contact for those BL's. This
 gives the BL a contact who is familiar with the block and who has a special interest in the success of the block.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">In addition to taking care of a particular group of blocks, the ND might
 have an </font>
<font color="#EAE7A6" face="Arial">area of responsibility</font>
<font face="Arial"> also such as Recruiting or Training or Tech or Events and so on. Again, this provides an </font>
<font color="#EAE7A6" face="Arial">additional point of reference.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#EAE7A6" face="Arial"><strong>An example </strong></font>
<font face="Arial">of a breakdown of such ND Assignments is shown below. Again, this is simply an
 alternative / option that may be used or adapted to suit personal hood needs.  Not all neighborhoods will
 use this format and the Neighborhood Leader may make any changes to the format she or he may desire.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The following table outlines ND's and their areas of responsibility. BL's should
 email their block report to their respective ND every two weeks. Although any ND & the NL are available
 to assist you with any issue, please refer to the following information to help guide your queries.</font></p>
