<p> </p><p><font size="3" face="Arial">Neighborhood message boards </font>
<font color="#EAE7A6" size="3" face="Arial">work essentially the same as block and personal message boards</font>
<font size="3" face="Arial">. Again graphics / sounds etc need to be linked to an external server. We have
 plenty of space on the colony server and ALL NLs are welcome to use it. You can contact your CD to get
 permission to use it. The configuration should be set to accept HTML tags. Also, as at the block level,
 a "message to all" blocks does not post to the neighborhood "messages" board. Those messages posted to
 all at a colony level will appear automatically on this board (but are not posted to block boards). </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The </font>
<font color="#EAE7A6" size="3" face="Arial">board should reflect the theme and spirit of the </font>
<font color="#EAE7A6" size="3" face="Arial">neighborhood</font>
<font size="3" face="Arial">. It can be changed as regularly as the NL sees fit but it is important that
 any links be maintained and kept up to date.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#EAE7A6" size="3" face="Arial"><strong>As per <a href="http://www.gamescolony.org/" target=_new>
Games Colony Guidelines</a>, neighborhood message boards <u>should</u> contain a link to the
 Games Colony Website.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Neighborhood boards are an </font>
<font color="#EAE7A6" size="3" face="Arial">excellent communication tool for publicizing block and
 neighborhood events</font>
 <font size="3" face="Arial">. It provides the medium for linking the separate blocks within a hood and
 can promote & encourage the team spirit needed for a successful neighborhood. It is the ideal place for
 announcing new block leaders & deputy promotions and keeping all neighborhood residents up to date of
 current block and neighborhood activities.</font></p>
