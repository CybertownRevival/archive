<P>The Training CS will work for the Training CD.<BR>
<P>The training CS will work with the training CD to update the training<BR>
website and to work out new colony policies to be submited to DannyKing (CL).<BR>
<P>The training CS should liase with the NL's and any training ND's to help<BR>
with training staff and if that hood has a training website to make sure<BR>
that is does not contradict the colony training website.<BR>
<P>The training CS will be required to help the training CD with training<BR>
new staff, the training CD used to train 60% of the staff and the CS 40%<BR>
but that has changed. It is no longer a requirement that all staff members<BR>
must be trained by the Training CD, but the NLs may choose to train their<BR>
own staff. ALL NEW NLs should be trained by the Training CD though.The<BR>
training CD will either inbox or email the training CS asking them to train<BR>
a particular person which should be done within 48 hours.<BR>
<P>The training CS is required to perform any tasks that the training CD<BR>
asks them to do as long as it does not break Cybertown nor Colony rules<BR>.
and bylaws.<BR>
