</p></center><P>Well not quit finished yet. Seems like CT has changed the way they do things and thus it
 has changed the way we can add backgrounds to our 2D house. Please use the following to do backgrounds now.:<br>
Before we go any further, I can not stress enough that, what you do with your 2D house is at your own risk!
 This tutorial is for teaching HTML only!<br>
Print out this instruction, or copy paste it to notepad so you can go through all the steps. Once you start,
 this window may close (unless this document opened in a new window).<br>
This Page has 2 parts. 1) How to modify your 2D house. and 2) How to fix your personal info<br>
<center><h2>How to modify your 2D house</h2></center>
Click the My Info button on the right above the Control Panel. Click the Personal Info button. Use your
 right-mouse button to click inside this window, and select View Source. A Textpad will open with the
  configuration/HTML of that window. Scroll down until you find a line that looks like this:
   <font color=yellow>action="/cgi-bin/cybertown/edit"</font> 
Change it to look like this: <font color=yellow>action="http://www.cybertown.com/cgi-bin/cybertown/edit"</font>
 So add the <font color=white>http://www.cybertown.com part.</font><br>
Then find the Home Page section that says:<font color=yellow> < INPUT NAME="HPG" VALUE="" MAXLENGTH=128 size=38 ></font> 
Between the "" after ..VALUE= you add the HTML for your 2D page.
(example:<br><br><center><font color=yellow>< INPUT NAME="HPG" VALUE="<br>
< style >< !--td{color:#80FF00 ;}div{color:#FF008;}<br>body{background-image: url(http://dannydking.com/background.jpg); <br>
scrollbar-3dlight-color: #FF008;<br>
scrollbar-arrow-color: #FF008;<br>
scrollbar-base-color:#FF008;<br>
scrollbar-darkshadow-color: #FF008;<BR>
scrollbar-face-color:#000000;<br>
scrollbar-highlight-color: #FF008;<br>
scrollbar-shadow-color: #FF008}-- >> < /style >" MAXLENGTH=128 size=38 > )</font></center><br><br>
This code is to put a background picture up, change the color of your text and change the color of the scrollbars.<br>
If you would like to add music, the code for that is:<br><br><font color=yellow><center>
< E mbed src="http://dannydking.com/music/kite.mid" autostart="false" controls="console" height="60" width="144" ></center></font><br><br>
Now click Save As... and save the file to your C: drive and call it "modify" (make sure to use the "" signs,
 or it won't work)<BR> 
Find the file icon you just saved, and drag it to the still open Personal Info window. (click the file ones
 and hold down your left-mouse button while you drag it into the open window).<BR> Then let go of the mouse
  and the new fixed code is there.<BR> 
Click Update. If you receive no errors, all went well. If it gives you an error, remove the code from your
 Homepage URL box in your Personal Info window and update. Not all HTML will be accepted anymore. Also make
  sure you added the <font color=white>http://www.cybertown.com</font> in front of the
   <font color=yellow>"/cgi-bin/cybertown/edit"</font> line.  
Don't close the Personal Info window yet, but click the 2D button to refresh your home and check if you did
 it correct.<BR><BR><BR><center>
<h2>How to fix your personal info</h2> (you did not listen and messed up...told ya not to do it)</center><BR><BR>
Click the My Info button on the right above the Control Panel. Click the Personal Info button.<br><br>
Use your right-mouse button to click inside this window, and select View Source.<br><br>
Scroll down until you find a line that looks like this: <font color=yellow>action="/cgi-bin/cybertown/edit"</font>
 and change it to look like this: <font color=yellow>action="http://www.cybertown.com/cgi-bin/cybertown/edit"</font>
 So add the <font color=white>http://www.cybertown.com</font> part.<br><br>Then find the Home Page section
 that starts with: NAME="HPG" VALUE=... and remove the bad code between the "". The correct code should be:
 <font color=yellow>< INPUT NAME="HPG" VALUE="" MAXLENGTH=128 size=38 ></font><br><br>Now click Save As...
 and save the file to your C: drive and call it "fixinfo" (make sure to use the "" signs, or it won't work)<br><br>
 Find the file icon you just saved, and drag it to the still open Personal Info window. (click the file ones
 and hold down your left-mouse button while you drag it into the open window). Then let go of the mouse and
 the new fixed code is there.<br><br>Click Update. If you receive no errors, all went well. If it still
 gives you an error, make sure you didn't remove much code from your HPG VALUE and make sure you added the
 <font color=white>http://www.cybertown.com</font> in front of the <font color=yellow>"/cgi-bin/cybertown/edit"</font>
 line.<br><br>Don't close the Personal Info window yet, but click the 2D button to refresh your home and
 check if you did it correct.</p></center></td>
