<H2>Home Security</H2><B>
Cybertown is a family Chat in houses and out. It would not be good for a young<BR>
child to come to a house where the Bot says nasty words or with nude pictures hanging<BR>
all over the walls. An adult BD or BL should be assigned to the task of in house<BR>
checking. If you don't have one, ask your ND or NL for help.<BR>
Check images, house names, and bots. Questionable images and messages should<BR>
be reported to the Neighborhood Leader up thru the staff so all are aware. Leave<BR>
a message with the resident that it is unacceptable and to change it immediately<BR>
or risk further action including House Deletion.<BR><P><I>
1. The Bot should be checked with normal speech, residents name, hello, hi,<BR>
bye, bots name, love, hate or whatever. Bots should be programmed within<BR>
city standards. Since it will be hard to check what a bot says, any bot programmed<BR>
to say unacceptable responses can lead to the house being referred to Security<BR>
and Deletion since this will be considered as being deceptive. If there<BR>
should be a problem with how a bot is programmed, the Block Leader must inform<BR>
their Neighborhood Deputy, and leave a polite message with the resident saying<BR>
that the bot is inappropriate for a family oriented place like Cybertown, and they<BR>
have 48 hours to change it.<BR><P>
2. In house pictures need checked. Images that are not appropriate, by CT Family<BR>
Standards, {Insert link to the Constitution here} should NOT be unchecked<BR>
and the Colony Deputy should be notified through staff reports.<BR><P>
3. Topic books can be opened when in the house. So check them for web sites that<BR>
could have anything in them.<BR><P>
4. Photo books can have many pages of 4 pictures each.<BR><P>
5. Guest book also needs checked.<BR><P>
6. Music box can also be checked.<BR><P>
7. Visit Counter needs checked. Yes it can be altered.<BR><P>
8. House Names must also be checked.  Names of homes should reflect job titles<BR>
and be acceptable by CT Family Standards. Anyone with a false title on their<BR>
house is at risk of Disciplinary action, including House deletion if the request<BR>
to remove title from their house is ignored or refused.<BR><P>
9. Message Boards, Inboxes, Information screens should also be checked.<BR>
If the Block Leader or a Block Deputy finds inappropriate pictures, links or things<BR>
on the information board, they need to take a screen shot, and contact their Neighborhood<BR>
Deputy. If the Neighborhood Deputy is unavailable, they should attempt to contact<BR>
either the Neighborhood Leader, or a Games Colony Deputy. If it is an inappropriate<BR>
picture, the Block Leader or Block Deputy should make sure it remains locked.<BR>
Then the resident should be left a polite message saying that the image, link or<BR>
information board is inappropriate, and they have 48 hours to change it. A copy of<BR>
all correspondence should be kept as a text file and send to the Neighborhood Deputy<BR>
who will send a copy to the Neighborhood Leader, and the Colony Deputy.<BR><P>
10. Home Pages must be checked. Anything linked or referred to must meet<BR>
CyberTown Family Standards. If you find Bad pictures or a nasty web site link you<BR>
need to contact your BL right away do not delay.<BR><P>
11. Picture Frames should also be checked. This is one item in Cybertown that is<BR>
often overlooked. ANY picture can be installed into a picture frame. Check these carefully.<BR><P></I>
Report any inappropriate messages or images to your Neighborhood Leader before<BR>
they are removed.  Remove old messages according to your Neighborhood's Policy.
