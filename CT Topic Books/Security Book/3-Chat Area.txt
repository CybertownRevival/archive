<u>Security and Security Procedures</U></center></h3><b>
It is of the utmost importance for residents of Games Colony to know, and be able<BR>
to follow the defined Security procedures in case of security problems<BR>
within their house or wherever they are chatting.</B> <BR><P><H3><center><u>Flooding, Swearing, or Inappropriateness in Public Chat</u></center></h3><B>
In the case of a person being obscene or behaving inappropriately in a public<BR>
chat room, the correct response is to, first inform the person that what they are doing<BR>
is not right, and politely ask them to refrain from what they are doing. Often<BR>
times a polite request will solve this problem. If the person ignores the request<BR>
to cease, then one should take screenshots and contact Security. To do this,<BR>
go to the Citizens Online link and at the bottom of the list there is a Security<BR>
Alert button. Press this, and into the message box, enter what is happening, and where<BR>
you are and press send. You may be asked to supply chat logs or screenshots<BR>
of what was said or done.</b>
